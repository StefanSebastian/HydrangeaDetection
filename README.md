# HydrangeaDetection
Machine learning project for detecting the Hydrangea invasive species in images.
I use keras CNNs to create autoencoders and kmeans clusterization to group encoded images in two groups.
Using dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/invasive-species-monitoring/data.
I obtained a 76% precision and 65% recall.
